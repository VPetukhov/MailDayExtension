Adds a button to Thunderbird, which shows pop-up with total number of Mail-Days and information about the oldest e-mail. Concept of Mail-Days was [described by Maxim Dorofeev](https://forum.mnogosdelal.ru/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=865) (Russian language). In essense, total number of mail days is equal to sum of squares of number of days since each message was recieved over all unread messages.
